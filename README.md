# Babylon PHP Test

Our product is an online marketplace, here is a sample of some of the products available on our site:
```
Product code  | Name                   | Price
----------------------------------------------------------
001           | Lavender heart         | £9.25
002           | Personalised cufflinks | £45.00
003           | Kids T-shirt           | £19.95
```

Our marketing team want to offer promotions as an incentive for our customers to purchase these items.
If you spend over £60, then you get 10% off of your purchase. If you buy 2 or more lavender hearts then the price drops to £8.50. 
Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because our promotions will change, it needs to be flexible regarding our promotional rules.  

Example checkout usage looks like this:
```php
$co = new Checkout($promotionalRules);
$co->scan($item);
$co->scan($item);
$price = $co->total();
```

You are provided with the set of interfaces. Implement a checkout system that fulfills the above requirements. During the implementation you are required to conform with the interfaces in this repository. Do this outside of any frameworks. We’re looking for candidates to demonstrate their knowledge of OOP as well as TDD.

Please clone this repository and when you are done, create pull request so we can review your work.
